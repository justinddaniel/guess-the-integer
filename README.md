# guess-the-integer

This is a guessing game that can be played in the console of Google Chrome when opening developer tools 
(ctrl + shift + i on PC) as well as on other browsers. The goal is to try to guess the number chosen randomly by the program. The number can be 1 to 100 inclusive. 

To play, simply copy and paste the code in code_challenge.js into the console of Google Chrome. Then call the function userPrompt() by name. To replay, simply clear the browser and then paste the JavaScript code in again.
